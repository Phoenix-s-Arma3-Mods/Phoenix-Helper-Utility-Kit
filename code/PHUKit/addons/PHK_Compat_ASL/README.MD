PHK_COMPAT_ASL:
An Advanced Slingload mod extender:

Recommended server-owner presets

“Vanilla-ish but better”:
    GlobalLiftMultiplier = 1.25
    MassClampMultiplier = 0.8

“Let owners lift anything”:
    GlobalLiftOverrideKg = 200000 (or whatever)
    OnlyIncreaseLift = true
    MassClampOverrideKg = 1 (yes, 1kg makes almost anything “liftable” if ASL engages)
    Heavy Lift Minimum Lift (kg): 0 (so it always engages)
